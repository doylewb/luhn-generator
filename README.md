luhn-generator
==============
This is a test project that shows how to generate a credit card number that
passes the mod10 test. This might be useful to generate fake entries to
post to a phishing site using TOR. Entries may pass muster at first glace
but the phisher may be searching for the needle in the haystack for the
real working entries.
